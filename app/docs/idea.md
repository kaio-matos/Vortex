# Idea

The user will be capable to input some endpoint and some configuration to do an HTTP request (like curl), but the idea here is to do something like these testing api programs.

## Features

-   The program must be an executable
-   The user should be able to save it's environment
-   The user should be able to request an api
-   The user should be able to save the used payload somewhere
-   The user should be able to use the saved payload and configuration to repeat the request

-   The user should be able to name the request?
